# Next.js To-Do List

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview
Created a simple to do list using nextJS, prisma and typescript.

## Key Learnings
Throughout the development of this project, several valuable insights were gained:

- <b>Folder Structure</b>: In Next.js, creating a new folder inside the app is essential for a new route to function correctly. This organized structure enables efficient routing and management of various components.

- <b>Server-Side Rendering</b>: Next.js provides a powerful feature of server-side rendering (SSR), allowing server-side code to be executed within components. This approach contrasts with traditional React applications that often require separate asynchronous calls with tools like Axios.

- <b>Client-Side Navigation</b>: The built-in Link component in Next.js offers seamless prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. This enhances the user experience by reducing loading times and making transitions smoother.

- <b>Server Components vs. Client Components</b>: In Next.js, components can be categorized as server components or client components, offering flexibility in optimizing performance. Understanding when to utilize each type is crucial for enhancing the application's efficiency

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
